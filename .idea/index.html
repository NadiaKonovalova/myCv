            <p> Hello! Now I am an engineer at the physics department at Riga Stradins University.
                It's quite a challenging job, but kind of interesting.
                Starting with screwing in screws, soldering connections, repairing the unrepairable;
                last but not least at my job is some stuff on the Moodle platform (putting our department studies activities for students).
            </p>
            <hr> My journey to IT and coding started in historical 2008 or 2009, in university with C++,
            how I can remember it was interesting, but not so deep in coding;
            just for medical devices' better understanding and for programming for some settings.
            </hr>
            <hr> And now after years .... more than 10! :D
            <p>
                I decided to try coding.
                First Boodcamp at Accenture She goes tech was my first step to coding, now I am at second step (second Boodcamp).
                I am not so far, but I still on my way!
                In Boodcamp we learn basics in JAVA, MySQL, HTML, and CSS.
